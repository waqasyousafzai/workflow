# Task Implementation       

## 1. Invocation Example

```markdown
@task-implementation.md execute on @task-file.md /grill-with-docs
/implement
```

## 2. Project Lifecycle Tracking — After Task Completion

Begin this section only after the grill-with-docs and implement state have been completed.

1. Identify the project associated with the task and locate the task's own entry in the relevant project folder, whether it is documented in a task file or a subprocess file.
2. Present the identified project to the user and wait for confirmation before updating project lifecycle documentation.
3. After confirmation, mark the completed task with a tick in its task or subprocess file.
4. If the completed task was the final task in that file, locate the project's lifecycle markdown and mark the corresponding lifecycle stage with a tick.

## 3. Remote Branch and Pull Request

1. Push the local branch to the remote repository.
2. Open a pull request targeting `main`.
3. Submit a formal review directly through GitHub's pull request review system, for example:

   ```bash
   gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment -b "..."
   ```
